# Text-Document-Similarity-Detection-Without-Using-Python-ML-Libraries
Building similarity detection ML codes from scratch using linear algebra.


Creating a python program that will compute the text document similarity between different documents. The implementation will take a list of documents as an input text corpus, and it will compute a dictionary of words for the given corpus. Later, when a new document (i.e, search document) is provided, the implementation should provide a list of documents that are similar to the given search document, in descending order of their similarity with the search document. For computing similarity between any two documents in our question, we are using the following distance measures (optionally, you are using  other set measures as well).

1. dot product between the two vectors

2. distance norm (or Euclidean distance) between two vectors .e.g. || u âˆ’ v ||

As part of answering the question, we can also compare and comment on which of the two methods (or any other measure if you have used some other measure) will perform better and what are the reasons for it.
